cppstats
========

What is it?
-----------

cppstats is a suite of analyses for measuring C preprocessor-based
variability in software product lines.

Currently, cppstats supports following analyses:
    - general,
    - generalvalues,
    - discipline,
    - featurelocations,
    - derivative, and
    - interaction.
For detailed information on each kind of analysis, please refer to the
corresponding paragraph below in this file.

For further information, please see the tool's homepage at:

Installation
------------

cppstats should be runnable under following systems:
- Linux/Ubuntu,
- Mac OS X, and
- Cygwin.

Please see the file called INSTALL for detailed instructions for each
system.

In detail, cppstats was successfully tested under:
- Ubuntu 12.04, Python 2.7.3, and
- Cygwin, Python 2.7.3.

Right now Python 3.x is NOT supported.


Quick Start
---------------------------------
- supply cppstats with the appropriate paths in 'cppstats_input.txt'
    * use full paths like
    "/local/repos/cpp-history/mpsolve/mpsolve-2.2" * each project
    folder given in the file has to be structured as follows:
        > /local/repos/cpp-history/mpsolve/mpsolve-2.2/
            > source/ (here are the C source files)

Then run:
$ ./cppstats.py --kind <K>
<K> must be one of the analyses listed in the introduction. Also, have
a look on "./cppstats.py --help" for further command line options.

The output files for each analysis are written to the folders given in
the file 'cppstats_input.txt'.


Analyses
--------

GENERAL:
    - Measurement of CPP-related metrics regarding scattering,
      tangling, and nesting
    - returns a list of metrics for each file, and a list of metric
      values for the whole project folder

GENERALVALUES:
     - Calculation of scattering, tangling, and nesting values
     - allows deactivation of the rewriting of #ifdefs to get a 'pure' result
         # rewriting changes #else branches from no used constant to the
          negation of the corresponding #if clause
     - returns a list for each characteristic, which #ifdef or configuration
       constant has which value (merged and unmerged)
         # unmerged: each #ifdef expression is counted once per file
         # merged: each #ifdef expression is counted once per project

DISCIPLINE:
    - Analysis of the discipline of used CPP annotations
    - returns the number of occurences for the categories listed below
        (1) check top level siblings (compilation unit)'
        (2) check sibling (excludes check top level siblings; NOT CLASSIFIED)'
        (4) check if-then enframement (wrapper)'
        (8) check case enframement (conditional)'
        (16) check else-if enframement (conditional)
        (32) check param/argument enframement (parameter)
        (64) check expression enframement (expression)
        (128) check else enframement (NOT CLASSIFIED)

FEATURELOCATIONS:
    - Analysis of the locations of CPP annotation blocks in the given
      file or project folder
    - returns a table with the following headers:
        # file
        # starting line
        # end line
        # type of the annotation (#if, #elif, #else)
        # the #ifdef expression
        # involved configuration constants

DERIVATIVE:
    # Analysis of all derivatives in the given project folder
    # returns all CPP annotations that involve shared code (expression
      contains '&&')

INTERACTION:
    # Analysis of pair-wise interactions of configurations constants
      that have been used alltogether in one expression (# of constants
      involved >= 3)
    # (A, B, C) -> |(A, B)? (A, C)? (B, C)? ...|
