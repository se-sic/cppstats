# this script checks include guards of c, cpp - header files
# and removes them:
# e.g.: test.h
# #if !defined(foo)
# #define foo ...
# #endif // foo
#
# parser works with following characteristics:
# - the include guard doesn't have to start at the first line
# and doesn't have to finish at the last line
#  - only one guard per file
#  - deleting first include-guard of following syntax
#  - include is formated like:
#     line x  : #if !defined(foo)
#     line x+1: #define foo
#     line x+2:  ...
#     line x+y: #endif
