# this script is made for changing macros that span over
# multiple lines (examples see below) to one line for
# better parsing
# e.g.:
# #define FillGroup1            \
#    "mov  r11,r2         \n\t" \
#    "mov  r10,r2         \n\t" \ ...
#
# effects all kind of macros #defines, conditionals, ...
